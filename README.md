UNDER DEVELOPMENT

To test or run: Set environment variables VAULT_ADDR as the address of vault and set GIT_TOKEN as a github login token.
If the Vault does not have a publicly signed Ca certificate, you may set VAULT_CACERT as the file location of the self-signed certificate for the vault server (.pem format).
